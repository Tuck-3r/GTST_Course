# What is Programming language

● It is language which helps to communicate with computers 
{they are not able to understand human languages}

● We humans have lots of 
languages(english,france,amharic,arabic..)

● Computers have this languages to

   ○ Assembly,C,C++,Java,Javascript,Python,Ruby,Perl,Go….

● Prog lang. Helps us to write programs using those languages

## What is Program?
● A program is an algorithm expressed in a programming 
language.

● An algorithm is a detailed sequence of actions to perform to 
accomplish some task. Named after an Iranian mathematician, 
Al-Khwarizmi.

● Technically, an algorithm must reach a result after a finite 
number of steps.

● With those steps Programs Do a Specific task Correctly.

### Algorithm Example

● To ask someone his/her name

a. You Walk to the person

b. Greetings

c. Wait for answer back

d. “What is your name?”

● This will be a lot of kinds of algorithms to do a specific task
Evolution of I/O { Input / Output }

● Early in the history of computing, programs were submitted on 
punch cards with all the data they required and executed together 
with other programs that used the same libraries. Output was to a 
line printer.

● Later developments introduced interactive processing which 
allowed the user to provide data while the program was running. 
This normally takes place in a Question & Answer format.

# Generation of Computers

1. First Generation: Vacuum Tubes => punch cards

2. Second Generation: Transistors => Programming started here with Assembly

3. Third Generation: Integrated Circuits => BASIC, COBOL, Pascal, Fortran, C, C++, Perl and Ada

4. Fourth Generation: Microprocessors => Python, SQL,Matlab

5. Fifth Generation: Artificial Intelligence


 they could only solve one problem 
at a time. It would take operators 
days or even weeks to set up a new 
Program on First Generation.

# Types of Programming Languages

● Computers Understand binary(0/1) , humans 
don’t understand this

● SO based on the closeness of the language to 
humans we classify it into 3 

● The more they become low to the machine they 
are faster.

● The more they become like human language they 
are slower.

   A) LOW level programming language

● These languages are more 
like machines but with lots 
of effort people can 
understand them. They 
are close to the hardware 
of the computer.

● Ex: Assembly

   B) High level Programming languages
● They are more close to 
human languages.

● Example: 
Python,C++,Java,JS…

C) Medium Level

● Languages Between Low 
level and High level, they 
combine both
● Ex: C-lang

# How do high level languages work?
As we saw earlier we have said that computers know only binarys, and if we code 
with high level languages how do computers understand us?

1) Compilers: are tools which helps to convert the whole code to bytecode then 
computer will execute it

a) Example: C,C++,Java,..

2) Interpreter: can directly execute the code by reading the source code line by 
line

a) Example: python

## What is Python Programming?
● Python is a High level & interpreted programming 
language. => Very easy to learn

● It is Very SImplified language any one can write with it, 
also can read it.

## History of python
● Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and 
early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and 
Computer Science in the Netherlands.

● Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, 
Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other 
scripting languages.

● Python is now maintained by a core development team at the 
institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in 
directing it's progress.

# IDE & Code editors
● IDE ( Integrated Development Enviroment ): Is a 
Software that helps to write & run a Specific Programming 
language. 

Example: PythonIDE

● Code Editors: are softwares those can help to write any 
kind of programming languages. And also by adding some 
compiling/ interpreting feature they can run 
programs/scripts

 Example: Sublime,Vscode
