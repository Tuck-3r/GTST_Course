# What is Bash Script?

● Bash = Bourne Again Shell

● It is a shell, that used to interact with your 
kernel.

# ● What is Script?

        ○ Script is a file that contains shell 
        commands.

● The original is sh - Bourne shell

# Uses of bash

● Script development

● Simplifying tasks

● Simplifying your linux ability

● Developing hacking scripts.

# Starting with Bash
● Bash files can have “.sh” extention but you can have it with out .sh too

● The file have to have executable Permissions.

● You can use any text editors u need: VIM,nano,VScode,gedit,cherrytree…

# Displaying output

● To start Every bash scripts use shebang.

        ○ #! /bin/bash

        ○ #! /bin/sh

● To display outputs on bash you just do 

        ○ echo “YOUR TEXT HERE”

● To run your project you can do:

        ○ /bin/bash hello.sh

        ○ ./hello.sh -> need x

        ○ hello -> need x

# Variables

● Bash Variables are same with python variables, with some exceptions.

● Syntax:

        ○ VARIABLE_NAME=value 

● Exceptions:

        ○ NO Space between the equal sign ( = )

    ■ NAME = “Nathan” => ERROR

    ■ NAME=”Nathan” => Correct.

    ■ Never Start with Numbers

    ■ USE double quotes only.

● To use the variable we will use dollar sign( $ ) before the Variable name

● If you want to display the variable sticked with other text use ${VARIABLE_NAME}

● Bash Variables are string by default. 

- Cont…

● The set command can be used to assign values to positional parameters.

● Syntax:

        ○ set value1 value2 value3 value4 value5

# System Variables

● Are variables those are declared by the system.

● There are so many: LANG, TERM,MAIL,EDITOR,USER,SHELL….

● USER displays Computer owner(host)

# Variables & Data Types

● As we saw, the previous method they create strings only.

● So to create other data types we use declare.

● Arrays

a) Arrays are lists or tuples on python.

b) Syntax: 

        i) var=(“list1” “list2” “list3” “list4)

        ii) TO display echo 

    (1) ${var[0]}

        iii) To get all the elements 

    (1) ${var[@]}

- cont…

i) To get the indexes 

    (1) ${!var[@]}

ii) To get the length 

    (1) ${#var[@]}

iii) To add element to the array 

    (1) var[4]=”list5”

iv) To remove from the array 

(1) unset var[3]

# Bash Input

● On bash we have 2 methods to accept input

1. Read function

2. Arguments

1) Bash read 

● Read used to accept inputs while the script is running.

● Syntax: 

        ○ read -p “Text To Display” var

        ○ read -sp “Password: ” var => used to accept hidden texts like password.

        ○ read -a var => for accepting arrays(lists)

2) Arguments

● These helps to get input before the script starts

● Syntax:

        ○ Just use $0-$9 while you want to work with the input

# Comments

On bash the comments are

For multi line comment we start with
        <<COMMENTS

        Sfasf

        Sfa

        COMMENTS , we close with this

# Bash sleep

● Sleep used to make a good waiting on our script.

● Syntax: 

    ○ sleep <number>s

# Operation
● To do mathematical operations you have to do $(( expression ))

● we will use let keyword for assigning variable

# A) Arithmetic Operations

    a) Addition $(( a + b ))

    b) Subtraction $(( a - b ))

    c) Multiplication $(( a * b ))

    d) Division $(( a / b ))

    e) Exponential $(( a ** b ))

    f) Modulo $(( a % b ))

# B) Assignment Operations 

    a) Increment “let a+= 3”

    b) Decrement “ let a-= 3”

    c) Multiply “ let a*= 3 “

    d) Divide “ let a/=3 “

- Cont…

# C) Comparison operation

## Alphabetic comparison

    - Greater Than => -gt

    - Less Than => -lt

    - Greater than and equals to => -ge

    - Less than and equals too => -le

    - Equal => -eq

    - Not equal => -ne
